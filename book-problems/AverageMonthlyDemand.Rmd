Suppose that monthly demand in units for a retail product is given by a normal distribution that has a mean of $`r mu`$ and standard deviation $`r sigma`$. Find the chance that that the average demand for the next 12 months is $`r xbar`$ or fewer units.


**_Solution:_**  

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/SamplingMeansLeftTailAreaSolution.Rmd"}
```
This is the chance the average demand for the next year is $`r xbar`$ or less.
