A store had some item out of stock in $`r count`$ of the past $`r n`$ weeks (the last 4 years). Calculate a $`r 100*confidence`\%$ confidence interval estimate for the proportion of weeks this item is out of stock.

**_Solution:_**  

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/ConfidenceIntervalProportionsSolution.Rmd"}
```

Our estimate is between $`r leftEndPtPercent` \%$ and $`r rightEndPtPercent` \%$
