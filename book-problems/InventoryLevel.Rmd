Suppose you have a retail item SKU with demand on average of $`r mu`$ units per month with a standard deviation of $`r sigma`$. What level inventory should you carry in the upcoming month to assure that you have $`r 100*area`\%$ service level on this item?

**_Solution:_**  

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/SolveBackwardsLeftTailSolution.Rmd"}
```
    
So you should have at least $`r ceiling(x)`$ for inventory to insure you have a $`r 100*area`\%$ service level.
