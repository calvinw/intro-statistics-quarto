Suppose that monthly demand in units for a retail product is given by a normal distribution that has a mean of $`r mu`$ and standard deviation $`r sigma`$. Find the chance that in a given month the product demand will be $`r x`$ or fewer units.

**_Solution:_**  

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/NormalLeftTailSolution.Rmd"}
```
    
This left tail area is the chance the demand will be $`r x`$ or less.
