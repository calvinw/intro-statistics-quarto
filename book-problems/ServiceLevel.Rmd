Suppose that monthly demand in units for a retail product is given by a normal distribution. Find the service level for service factor of $z=`r z`$.

**_Solution:_**  

The service level can be found by finding the left tail area for the given service factor $z$-value.

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/StdNormalLeftTailSolution.Rmd"}
```
     
This left tail area is the **service level**. A service level of $`r nearestPercent`\%$ means that there is just a $`r 100-nearestPercent`\%$ chance of lost sales in given month.
