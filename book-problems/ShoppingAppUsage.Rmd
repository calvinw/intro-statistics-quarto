A department store thinks that $40\%$ of their customers would use a shopping app while in-store. They poll $`r n`$ users one day and find out that $`r count`$ of them would use such an app. Find a $`r 100*confidence`\%$ confidence interval for this sample proportion.

**_Solution:_**  

```{r child="../statplosion-problems/solution/ConfidenceIntervalProportionsSolution.Rmd"}
```
    
The confidence interval does not contain $40\%$ and so probably the store is overestimating what proportion of their customers would use such an app. It appears to be somewhat less than $40\%$.
