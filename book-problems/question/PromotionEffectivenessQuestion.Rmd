Suppose a store manager thinks that $`r 100*p`\%$ of its customers would upgrade to a more expensive item during a promotion. You work there as well and find the store manager\'s claim too high. To find out, you sample $`r n`$ customers and find out $`r count`$ of them would upgrade. Does the evidence support the store manager\'s claim?
