### To Students {-} 

This OER book is intended to help students in introductory statistics courses. The intended audience is non-science majors. We do not include formal proofs but instead focus on step-by-step examples and try to explain statistical concepts in everyday terms.

### To Instructors {-} 

The techniques used in this book are similar to *Mathplosion* [@mathplosion] but updated to use *Bookdown* [@R-quarto].

Quarto is based on the RMarkdown format, see *The R Markdown and knitr Book* [@xie2015]
