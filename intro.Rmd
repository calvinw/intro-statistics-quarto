### To Students {-}

This OER book is intended to help students in introductory statistics courses. The intended audience is non-science majors. We do not include formal proofs but instead focus on step-by-step examples and try to explain statistical concepts in everyday terms.

### To Instructors {-}

The techniques used in this book are similar to [*Mathplosion*](http://mathplosion.com) but updated to use [*Quarto*](http://quarto.org) publishing system.

The previous version of this book used [@R-bookdown] and the wonderful RMarkdown format. See *The R Markdown and knitr Book* [@xie2015]
